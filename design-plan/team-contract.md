# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Contract

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    - Getting our work done on time
    - Communicating conflicts
    - Being respectful to client and each other
    - Putting best effort in work

2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive listâ€”stick with just a few.)
    - Arrive on time for meetings for with the client
    - Take responsibility for your own work and hold each other accountable for work that needs to get done
    - Communicate any conflicts (need extension, etc)
    - Reach out if there is merge conflicts

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    - We will discuss in a text message group chat
    - We will meet once or twice between each milestone but we will be communicating very frequently.

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    - We will schedule meetings before each milestone
    - We will keep in touch with them through text message

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

    **Tip:** It's often helpful to think of **responsibilities** rather than roles here.

    - Reid will be the main person of contact with the client
    - Everyone will be in charge of coding and structuring one main page of the website
    - Everyone will take an active role in the visual design

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    - We will give honest critique and rebuke team members who are not contributing

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    - We will communicate our conflicts and refer back to this contract.
    - When there is a conflict, we will regroup and take decisions on the next steps forward as a group

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    - Whenever there exists a conflict we will re-visit this contract and cite the information we wrote.

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause...

    **Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

    - We will celebrate at the end.

- We will create more specific roles once we meet with our client.

## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300-prof@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
