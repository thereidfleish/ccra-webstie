**CORNELL COMPUTER REUSE ASSOCIATION**

Mission Statement:
Expanding Computer Literacy Through Sustainability

The Cornell Computer Reuse Association (CCRA) is a Cornell student group whose mission is to donate computers and other computer-related technology to humanitarian organizations in the developing world, the local Ithaca community, and elsewhere.

About us:
We collect and refurbish computers, and then donate them to community centers, orphanages, schools, and other organizations.

Since 2006, we have donated over 1,900 [UPDATE NUMBER] computers at no cost to outstanding organizations all over the world.

**Donate Computers or Equipment to Us**

We are always very happy to accept because we can turn them around and put them to good use for a good cause. We frequently receive donations from Cornell University departments, labs, individuals, libraries, independent groups, and a lot of other organizations. The CCRA is an excellent way to:

- Support a good cause, increase computer literacy around the globe and put older machines to new use
- Save $$$ on the cost of recycling or throwing away older equipment
- Get rid of computers or equipment you no longer use or don’t have space for anymore

**Things We Are Very Happy to Accept**

- Desktop computers and laptop computers (very high demand but low supply!) that have at least one of the older versions of the Intel Core microarchitecture or similar generation hardware from ~2006 on. Note that we may also take some Pentium IV and similar machines depending on the specifications (newer = more likely, older = less likely). For Apple computers, we accept anything that has been manufactured since Apple’s switch to Intel processors from PowerPC.
- LCD monitors of any size (high demand and harder to find!)
- Mice, keyboards, hard drives (40GB+), USB sticks, peripherals
- Some other hardware such as scanners, printers, etc. (these depend on a lot of factors)

**Things We Do Not Accept**

- Really old computers and equipment that is well past modern use (usually defined as Pentium IV and older)
- CRT monitors (too heavy, hazardous materials, a problem for techno-dumping)
- Very large items like office copiers, huge fax machines, etc.

**Request a Donation of Computers from Us**

We want to help as many organizations succeed as possible, but at any given time, we typically have a sizable backlog of requests. It will help if your organization has:

- A clearly defined mission/purpose for the computers
- A well-put-together proposal that shows commitment, effort, and seriousness
- A good reputation, with credible sources that can vouch for you
- An area of focus (geographic, social, etc) with clear and demonstrable need
- IT staff or individuals that may be able to support the computers
- Good communication with our team so we can establish a sustainable relationship

The above qualities are not necessary to request computers, but can help your organization stand out when we are prioritizing our donations.

Some other things to know

- Being a student group, we are not able to cover the cost of shipping computers. Generally, groups requesting computers will cover the cost of shipping. Inside of the United States, many commercial shipping companies do offer free shipping to not-for-profit corporations.
- As a general policy, we donate to only organizations and not to individuals.
- Due to a large demand and limited supply of computers, we typically cap our first donation at 20 computers.
- Because we are a student organization, requests submitted during the academic year will be evaluated more quickly than those submitted during the summer.
